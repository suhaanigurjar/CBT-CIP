# Data Science Projects

This repository contains two projects developed as part of the Data Science Internship at CipherByte Technologies:

1. **Iris Flower Classification Model**: A machine learning project focused on classifying Iris flowers based on their physical measurements.
2. **Time Series Forecasting**: A project for analyzing and predicting trends in time series data.

Below is a detailed overview of the **Iris Flower Classification** project.

## Iris Flower Classification Model

### Data Science Internship - CipherByte Technologies

This project involves training a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into one of three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, or **Virginica**. The classification is based on the measurements of the flowers' sepals and petals.

### Task Overview

The Iris Flower Classification task includes:

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Visualizing the data to understand the distribution of features
- Training a Logistic Regression model on the Iris dataset
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy, classification report, and cross-validation
- Predicting the species of Iris flowers based on new data inputs

### Dataset Description

The Iris dataset consists of the following features:
- **Sepal Length (cm)**
- **Sepal Width (cm)**
- **Petal Length (cm)**
- **Petal Width (cm)**
- **Species** (Target variable: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

### Libraries and Tools Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**: For data visualization
- **Plotly**: For interactive scatter plot visualizations
- **Scikit-learn**: For model training, evaluation, and metrics

## Results

The model is evaluated based on:
- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correct predictions.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Analyzes how well the model classifies each species.
- **Cross-Validation**: Ensures model stability across different subsets of the dataset.

## Conclusion

This Iris Flower Classification project successfully demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a machine learning model using the Logistic Regression algorithm for classification tasks.
